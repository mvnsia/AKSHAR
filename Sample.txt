GLOBAL VILLAGE STORIES – A relational art project
Description:
128 very short stories in English language (at most 4 lines) were exhibited in the gallery space in
The Art Folk High School, Holbæk, Denmark. They were framed in 20 A4 frames, that is
around 6-7 stories per frame. 
They have been collected using the Internet in the period February-April 2009. They are coming
from more than 50 different countries. Some contributors have sent more than one story. Some
were too long then I have shortened; others were not in English language then I have to translate
them.
